# Use WMS and INSPIRE extended capabilities

**Purpose**: Test that INSPIRE metadata are mapped to WMS capabilities elements to its full extent and the elements that cannot be mapped so ISO 19128 are implemented as Extended Capabilities.

**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

**Reference(s)**:
* [TG VS](./README.md#ref_TG_VS), Chapter 4.2.3.3.1, Requirement 7

**Test type**: None

**Notes**

This test only applies to [scenario 2](./README.md#scenarios).

The testing of the mapping between INSPIRE metadata elements and ISO 19128 WMS elements is implemented in the Abstract Tests from [at10](./at10-getcapabilities-title-and-abstract.md) to [at29](./at29-getcapabilities-metadata-date.md).

**Contextual XPath references**

The namespace prefixes used as described in [README.md](./README.md#namespaces).

Abbreviation                                               |  XPath expression (relative to /wms:WMS_Capabilities)
